# AnalyzeVDP
Convert data taken from van der Pauw measurements to find Rxx and Rxy

# Input data
Data is assumed to be in CSV format. I wrote some helper functions that also assume the data was taken from the Quantum Design PPMS Dynacool system, which uses a resistivity module to read out the average resistances from oppositely polarized source currents.

# Output data
Data will be put out in CSV format as well.
